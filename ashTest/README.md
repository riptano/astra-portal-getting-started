## 1 How to get started
### Drop itâ€¦
Drop your body down to the ground while bending your knees. You'll want to keep your head up and your back straight. Imagine you just took a pizza out of the oven and accidentally dropped it, and now you have to pick it back up. 

**Pro-tip**
Grab a spatula to help you flip it back over in the next step.

## 2  Picking it back up
### â€¦like it's hot
You're going to have to put your thing down, flip it and reverse it in order to get it back up. When you pick it back up, add a little flair/flare. Act like it's hot and you've just burned yourself. Shake it off. Now go run it under cold water before getting an ice pack.

```shell
ouch that-hurt
```

```<<createDatabase>>```

<<iceIt>>

## 3 Park it
The final step is to park it like it's hot. You've acquired your ice pack, and now it's time to sit down on the couch and take a break. That's how you get ahizzead.
