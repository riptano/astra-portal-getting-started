## Introduction

Our **JSON API** is an HTTP API and part of the [Stargate](https://stargate.io) open source project. The idea is to provide an abstraction on top of Apache Cassandra™ to allow document-oriented data access patterns. Any application code that can call an HTTP end point can interact with our JSON API.

Our JSON API works best with the associated Mongoose for Astra client library. Now you can run your Mongoose applications on Astra with only a configuration change. Download Mongoose for Astra from [Github](https://github.com/stargate/stargate-mongoose).

**To Do List Application**
  
Here we provide a fullstack development example of a simple to do list, using Astra DB's sandbox environment as the storage backend (this means your data will not persist beyond this browser session).
