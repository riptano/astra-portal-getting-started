Our **JSON API** is an HTTP API and part of the [Stargate](https://stargate.io) open source project. The idea is to provide an abstraction on top of Apache Cassandraâ„¢ to allow document-oriented data access patterns. Any application code that can call an HTTP end point can interact with our JSON API.
